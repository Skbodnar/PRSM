This project was created for Adam Karl, who is an industrial designer, professor, and outdoor recreation enthusiast. The development team included students from Burlington Code Academy (Jack Lavallee, Jedda Bragg, Sophie Bodnar, and Trenton Poitras).

The project is open source under the MIT License.

STORY BEHIND THE APPLICATION:
Adam wanted to create a product insight application that would help product developers better understand consumer needs. 

A few key questions were crucial to Adam’s desire to improve consumer discovery:
- How can brands tap into peoples’ passions and have transparent conversations about what people use and need.
- How can brands reward consumers for sharing their insights?
- How can brands contribute to a sustainable future for our planet? 

For this first iteration, Adam wanted to develop an adaptive survey for the medical community. His aim was to gather data on consumer’s needs and frustrations related to surgical footwear.

THE VISION FOR THIS APPLICATION:
A service that enables brands to connect with passionate people, create adaptive surveys, track survey progress, and make consumer discoveries
A hub for consumers who are passionate people and are excited to share their insights with the brands they care about. And get rewarded with brand discounts

DYNAMIC SURVEY PROCESS: 
Each survey begins with 3 demographic questions and follows a pattern of 5 question types: “Short answer”, “Long answer”, “Multiple Choice”, “Keyword”, and “Ranking”. The 5th question type, “Ranking” asks the user to rank responses on a particular topic.

The ranking options available are dynamically generated from the consumer’s previous responses to Question type #1: “Short answer” as well as Question type #4: “Keyword”.
